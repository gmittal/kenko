Glean nutritional insight by snapping a picture of your food. 

Originally known as Shokuji, this was [our hack](http://devpost.com/software/kenko-dnovlh) for [PennApps XII](http://2015f.pennapps.com/) (Fall 2015) that allowed us to make the top 10, win the Best Cloud-based App (courtesy Goldman Sachs), and win 3rd Place (District CA-18) for the 2015 Congressional App Challenge.
